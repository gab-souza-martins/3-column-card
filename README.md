## My process

### What I'm proud of
I'm proud of being able to complete this challenge rather quickly. Though it took some time for me to upload it, I completed the challenge in just a few hours of work. Hopefully I can keep this pace up going forward.

### What I would do differently
For this challenge, I went with a mobile-first approach, as opposed to the desktop-first one of my previous challenge. However, I still had some of the same difficulties, so I'm wondering if there is a way to combine both approaches. I'll have to look that up.

### What challenges I faced
Flexbox was something I had some problem with, as it's a new concept to me, but I suppose it's something I'll just need to get experience with through trial and error.

Other challenges I faced were with the border radius and vertical alignment, as I'll detail on the next section.

### What I would like help with
I would like help with both border radius and vertical alignment. The latter seems the easiest of them, however I still had trouble finding some kind of solution that worked with the actual grid as a whole, instead of just the elements inside it. 

As for the former, I could not find any way to make the flexbox's border look rounded the way I wanted. It either slanted horizontally or vertically, broke in different screensizes, or had a point instead of a smooth roundness. Often it was a mix of all of these problems. If anyone knows how to make good rounded borders easily, please let me know.
